### Project Overview
1. The objective of this project is to gain insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and performance within the
organization by performing data analysis on the HR dataset.
2. To identify the patterns, trends and potential areas for improvement that can help the company better understand and manage
employee attrition and performance.
3. Tools used in this project are Excel, SQL , Power BI and Tableau.

### Problem Statement
1. The high rate of employee attrition can have significant implications for organizations, leading to increased recruitment and training
costs, reduced productivity, and decreased employee morale.

8. Total Working Years, DailyRate, Hourly Rate, and Monthlty Rate do not exhibit any correlation with Attrition Rate. 
9. Employee who has worked for 2 to 4 years in the same role are having very high attrition rate. Employee who has worked for 10+ years in the same role are having low attrition. Employees gaining 2 to 4 years experience are leaving the organisation. May be they are finding better opportunity somewhere else.
10. Most of the employees have rated their job satisfaction same for all level. Employees who rated their job satisfaction low are mostly leaving the organization.
11. we can't generate any meaningful inisghts from percentage salary hike,performance rating and relationship rating with attrition rate
12. Attrition rate is high at the Entry Level for 1 and 2 level compared to other levels. As the level increases the attrition rate decreases.
13. The Distance From Home doesn't follows any trend in attrition rate.
14. The attrition rate is same around all relationship status but its slightly higher in case of single and divorced.
15. Attrition Rate is around 25 % for 1 year since last promotion. Almost 49% of employee has not been promoted about 1 to 4 years. attrition rate is also around 49% in case of 1 to 4 years.
16. Almost 56.63% of employees has worked for 1-5 years with the same manager. Employees has worked for 1-5 years with the same manager is having high attrition rate.

### Recommendations:

### Limitations 
- The datasets might lack certain contextual information about the employees, such as personal challenges, external factors affecting their work, or specific project details. This missing context could limit the depth of your analysis.
-The analysis might not cover all relevant factors contributing to attrition, such as organizational culture, leadership styles, or macroeconomic factors. A more comprehensive analysis would require a broader scope.
- The analysis appears to focus on descriptive statistics and visualization. While these provide insights into historical data, incorporating predictive models could enhance the project by forecasting future attrition trends.
- Implementing A/B testing methodologies could provide a more scientific approach to understanding the impact of specific interventions or policies on employee attrition.
- Machine learning algorithms, like classification or clustering, could offer deeper insights. Not utilizing advanced ML techniques might limit the depth of your analysis.
